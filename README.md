# SineDrill
<b>HTML5 Application to test your knowledge of the Sinusoid</b>

This is a program for testing your knowledge of the Sinusoid. You are presented with a Red sinusoid, and you need to enter the values of 
Amplitude, Frequency and Phase Shift; when you enter these values, the Blue curve gets modified. You need to match the Red and Blue Curves. 
You can select from two levels - Novice and Professional.

Inspired by the Example Matlab Program in the book "Signal Processing First" by McClellan, Schafer and Yoder
